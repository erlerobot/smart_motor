//  PD2      - EN_A     - PWM enable direction A
//  PD3      - EN_B     - PWM enable direction B
//  PD4      - SMPLn_B  - BEMF sample enable B
//  PD7      - SMPLn_A  - BEMF sample enable A
//

// turning on or off one of the MOSFETs). This is to prevent improper states from occurring
// in the H-bridge and leading to brownouts or "crowbaring" of the supply. This was more
// of a problem, prior to the introduction of the delay, with the faster processor clock
// rate that was introduced with the V3 boards (20MHz) than it was with the older8Hhz V2.1
// boards- there was still a problem with the old code, with that board, it was just less
